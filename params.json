The Open API Initiative Specification (the spec formally known as Swagger 2.0) mentions the support for vendor extensions to the spec throughout. Where are these vendor extensions? What additional expressions of an API do those vendor extensions allow? What tools support those extensions?\r\n\r\nThis project aims to answer those questions.\r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\n\r\nOne day this section will be a big, formal index of all the wonderful edge cases supported by vendor extensions. For now, there's just this short list.\r\n\r\n* [x-json-schema](https://github.com/vendorextensions/x-json-schema): This extension adds key components of JSON Schema back into Swagger.\r\n\r\n## Get In Touch\r\n\r\nThe Vendor Extensions project is maintained by @claylo.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
